### HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

#### Installation

Text

##### Install Miniconda

To test your installation, in your terminal window or Anaconda Prompt, run the command: 
```bash
$ conda list
```
And you should obtain the list of packages installed in your base environment.

##### Create your Miniconda environment

>  Notice: This repository has been designed in order to allow being executed with two different environments. If you have a GPU in your computer, make use of the file "environment_gpu.yml" during the next section, in case you only have CPU, use the file "environment.yml" to prepare your environment.

Execute:

```bash
 $ conda env create -f environment_gpu.yml
```

This will generate the `videoprocgpu` environment with all the required tools and packages installed.

Once your environment had been created, activate it by typing:

```bash
$ conda activate videoprocgpu
```
