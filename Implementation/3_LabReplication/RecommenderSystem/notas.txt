Puntos a mirar:

1 - In Exec Class, "split_train_test", line 25, why sorted_data is empty?
2 - Confirm the time of execution for all process
3 - Look size of self.test_x[:,:2], main.py, line 128
4 - What about Picker?
5 - Do we need to generate graphics?
6 - Add comments in model POP
7- In exec.py, func train_one_epoch, line 72/73, now we are using "predictions = model(interactions[:,:2])"
